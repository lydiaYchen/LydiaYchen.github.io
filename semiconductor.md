title: AI for Semiconductor
---

The **semiconductor industry** faces complex problems such as **root-cause analysis** and **predicting maintainance** which can benefit from collaboration between multiple parties.
However, strict confidentiality requirements prevent such cooperation.
We enable collaborative machine learning while protecting proprietary information.
